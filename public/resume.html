            Worked on the validation of the pricing models and risk engine. Main activities: implemented pricing models
            to obtain both market and fair prices of financial instruments such as bond futures and commodity future
            (spread) options. Developed forecasting model of Interest Rate volatility and stochastic model of IR movements.
            Worked on the generation of risk factors (par bond rates) from yield curves scenarios to perform historical VaR
            simulations in Risk models. Conducted qualitative analysis on the generation of stress test scenarios. Applied
            myself to calculate the default probability of CDS reference entities.
